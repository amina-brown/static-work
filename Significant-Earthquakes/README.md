# Significant Earthquakes

These pieces explore the significant earthquakes that occurred within a 30-day span and were recorded 
by the USGS real time feed. Specifically, the two pieces are focused on the varying locations and magnitudes 
of the earthquakes. The Significant Earthquakes piece represents all significant (6 mww or greater) events 
within the time span, while the Aftershock piece focuses on just three of those events occurring on the same 
day in one region of Chile. Given the behavior of seismic events, the first earthquake likely triggered the 
next two events. Due to the variety of types of earthquake magnitudes, only earthquakes measured using the 
Moment W-phase unit (mww) are represented. Since this scale is logarithmic, the diameter of the string 
representation is calculated using the inverse in order to show the relative differences in magnitude.
